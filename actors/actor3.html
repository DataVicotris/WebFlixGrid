            <h2>Denzel Washington</h2>

            <p>
                Denzel Hayes Washington, Jr. was born on December 28, 1954 in Mount Vernon, New York. He is the middle
                of three children of a beautician mother, Lennis, from Georgia, and a Pentecostal minister father,
                Denzel Washington, Sr., from Virginia. After graduating from high school, Denzel enrolled at Fordham
                University, intent on a career in journalism. However, he caught the acting bug while appearing in
                student drama productions and, upon graduation, he moved to San Francisco and enrolled at the American
                Conservatory Theater.</p>


            <p>He made his first big screen appearance in Carbon Copy (1981) with George Segal. Through the 1980s, he
                worked in both movies and television and was chosen for the plum role of Dr. Philip Chandler in NBC's
                hit medical series St. Elsewhere (1982), a role that he would play for six years. In 1989, his film
                career began to take precedence when he won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of
                Tripp, the runaway slave in Edward Zwick's powerful historical masterpiece Glory (1989).</p>
