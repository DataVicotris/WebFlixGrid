            <h2>Sonic 3</h2>

            <p>In Tokyo, a prison for the corporation G.U.N.s security is breached, waking up Shadow and allowing him to
                make his escape. Meanwhile, Sonic is celebrating his anniversary since arriving on Earth with Tails and
                Knuckles, when the G.U.N. Director, Rockwell arrives and announces Shadows escape. Rockwell recruits the
                trio and calls them "Team Sonic".</p>


            <p>The trio battle Shadow, only to discover that he is way stronger than them and he runs away. Team Sonic
                go to meet G.U.N. commander Walters and he reveals that the corporation had discovered Shadow in 1974 in
                a meteorite. Shadow used his powers for various experiments, but things took a turn for the worse, the
                project leader was arrested and Shadow was put into stasis. To make matters worse, Dr Robotnik arrives
                with an army of drones, fatally wounding Walters. Just before he dies, Walters hands Sonic a digital key
                card and asks him to remain safe. Team Sonic don't know who to trust anymore, so they decide to battle
                Shadow without the aid of G.U.N. Agent Stone reveals that Robotnik is still living and didn't send the
                drones. The trio join Robotnik and they follow the drones to a deserted G.U.N. base.</p>
