            <h2>Kraven</h2>

            <p>Kraven's complex relationship with his ruthless father, Nikolai Kravinoff, starts him down a path of
                vengeance with brutal consequences, motivating him to become not only the greatest hunter in the world,
                but also one of its most feared.</p>


            <p>In Siberia, the prisoner Sergei Kravinoff kills the drug lord Semyon Chorney in a maximum-security prison
                and flees to meet his partner that is waiting for him in an airplane. While traveling back home, Sergei
                recalls his saga sixteen years ago, when his father Nikolai Kravinoff travels with his brother Dmitri
                "Dima" to Tanzania for a hunting trip to prepare them to take over his drug trafficking business in the
                future. When Nikolai hits a lion, the wounded animal will attack Dima, but Serge protects him.</p>
